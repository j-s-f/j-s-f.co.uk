<h2><a name="H&amp;T"></a>Hints and tips:</h2>

<p>You can enter fractions (1/4  1/6 etc.) in the Quantity field for order editor.<br>
When you use the <a href="#GreenSquares">green Squares</a> to mark an item, it orders the same qty as last 
time.</p>

<h2>Getting going</h2>
<p>This is a complex tool, and these instructions will not be enough to enable 
you to use it fully.<br>
however here are a few reminders about what does what.</p>
<h3>Name and Password:</h3>
<p>This is required to record who did what, and to let you amend data.&nbsp;<br> Use 
your own name, see John Fisher for the password. Or use name ipswichripplecic.</p>
<h3>Normal view:</h3>
<p>below is a screenshot from the analysis tool:</p>
<p><img src="Analinstructions_files/instr_anal2.JPG" border="2" width="1083"></p>
<p>Each row represents a product.</p>
<p>Each dated column is either a Session, an Order (delivery), or a Stock-take.&nbsp;
</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse" id="AutoNumber1" border="1" bordercolor="#111111" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" width="984">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="Analinstructions_files/instr_session.JPG" border="0" height="54" width="106"></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="Analinstructions_files/instr_order.JPG" border="0" height="30" width="81"></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td valign="top" width="324"><b>Session:</b><br>
    the 2000 in this example<br>
    is the amount sold in the <br>
    session<br>
    The 750 in brackets is the calculated<br>
    amount left over after the session.<br>
    Hover the mouse over the top figure, to see how many purchases, click to see them.</td>

    <td valign="top" width="385"><b>Order:</b><br>
    Here the + simply means it's a delivery.<br>
    You can click on the <font color="#0000FF"><u>5</u></font> to edit <br>
    the amount, if say, the delivery did not happen<br>
    The 8 in brackets is the calculated<br>
    amount after delivery.</td>

    <td valign="top" width="243"><b>Stocktake:</b><br>
    the equals sign means it's<br>
    a real stocktake.<br>
    You can click on the <font color="#0000FF"><u>3</u></font> to<br>
    edit the amount, if necessary</td>

    <td valign="top" width="243"><b>Average:</b><br>
    this the average consumption per session<br>
    You can click on the <font color="#0000FF"><u>H</u></font> to<br>
    see the history over the previous year</td>

  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>Hovering over numbers.</h3> 
This usually informative:<br>
In the case of sessions this shows the individual purchase quantity:<br>
<img src="Analinstructions_files/instr_purchases.jpg" height="77" width="252">

<p>The two columns on the very right show the average sold per session, and the 
number of sessions that the remaining stock would therefore last for.&nbsp; <br>
If the number of sessions is less that 0.75 it is coloured red, if less than 1.5 
it's pink.</p>
<p>You can see notes on each product by hovering the mouse over the left or right 
hand cells in each row.</p>
<a name="NotesP">
<h3>Notes panel.</h3> 
Hovering over the product code, or the notes icon (<img src="Analinstructions_files/notes.bmp">) shows you a preview of the notes:<br>
<img src="Analinstructions_files/notes1.jpg"><br>

Clicking on the product code, or the notes icon, brings up an editable notes panel,<br>
where you can record comments about this item for future reference.<br>
<img src="Analinstructions_files/notes2.jpg"><br>
The links across the bottom, allow you add text in the correct format to mark the item...<br>
<ul>
<li> .. for order (with quantity)&nbsp; &nbsp;  - Use <u><i>Add</i></u> link</li>
<li> .. with a  re-order quantity preset &nbsp; &nbsp;- Use <u><i>Remove</i></u> link when already in order</li>
<li> .. as NO-Reorder &nbsp; &nbsp;- Use <u><i>NoReorder</i></u> link</li>
<li> so that it refers to other items (e.g. substitutes) &nbsp; &nbsp;- Use <u><i>Also</i></u> link</li>
</ul>
You can remove these attributes by simple deleting the "ORDER/ALSO" line from the notes.
You can adjust the order quantity by editing the number in the "ORDER:" line.
<p></p>

<h3>Expanded view:</h3>
<p>Here all sessions are show with 1 group of 4 cells per session.</p>
<p>This view shows "virtual stocktakes" for days when there was in fact no 
stocktake.</p>
<img src="Analinstructions_files/expanded.gif" border="1" height="772" width="558">
</a><a name="notes"></a>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>The notes that you can see on normal view, are editable in expanded view without bringing up the Notes Panel. <br>
<img src="Analinstructions_files/edit_gray.gif" border="1" height="315" width="737"><br>
When you are done, click on the Save button beneath.<br>
The Save button is normally greyed-out, but becomes usable when the notes are edited.
</p>
<p>These notes are now visible at the till. You can use them to explain ordering policy</p>
<a name="Ordering">
<h3>Ordering:</h3>
<p>Products can be flagged for ordering by inserting an appropriate line in the 
notes for the product.</p><pre>ORDER:GH064,1</pre><p></p>
 The Add link in the "Quicklinks:" section does this for you, The Remove link takes it away.<br>
Remember:You still need to save the notes afterwards.<br><br>
See also "</a><a href="#GreenSquares">green Squares</a>" below.
<h3>No Re-Order:</h3>
<p>Products can be flagged so they never appear normally in the analysis, <br>
by inserting a different appropriate line in the notes for the product:</p><pre>NOREORDER:CV253,1</pre><p></p>
<p>The "NoReorder" link below the notes does this for you.<br>
Remember:You still need to save the notes afterwards.
</p><hr>
<h3>Filters:</h3>
<p>There are 6 levels of filter, together with a textual filter. This cuts down 
the number of products on-screen and allows you to think about each in turn:</p>
<img src="Analinstructions_files/instr_anal_filter.JPG" height="233" width="233">
<ul>
<li>All levels - Shows all products <i>EXCEPT NOREORDER products</i>.</li>
<li>0 - 0.75 - Shows products that very probably need ordering.</li>
<li>0.75 0 1.5 - Shows products that might need ordering.</li>
<li>1.5 - 2.5, 2.5 - 999  - etc,</li>
<li>Infinity - Shows products that have NOT SOLD AT ALL <u>during the averaging period</u></li>
<li>Needs S/Tk - Products that haven't been stocktaken in the last averaging period.</li>
<li>No-Reorder Lines - Shows products that we've decided not to re-order. These are not shown in any other filter setting.</li>
<li>Current Order - Shows products currently flagged for order : (<img src="Analinstructions_files/ForOrder.GIF" height="16" width="16">).</li>
<li>In Last order column - Shows products that have been ordered/delivered for the last session.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text filter can be used to enter codes: "FX503"  or "oats" <br>
<br>
There are 2 special text filter settings:<br>
- "order" shows you products flagged for ordering,<br>
- "anomaly" shows you products flagged with ! in their stocktake columns because of "evaporation", or unexpected loss of stock.
</p>
<a name="max"></a>
<h3>Max sold</h3>
<p> There is a max sold column which shows the max amount of the item that is sold in any one session.
Hovering over it shows the date, so you could investigate further.:<br>
<img src="Analinstructions_files/max-sold.gif" border="1" height="129" width="728"><br>
if there is a large blue exclamation mark : 
<img src="Analinstructions_files/info.gif" height="19" width="19">, then that means that the max. qty is greater than the case size.

</p>

<hr>
<a name="Upload"></a>
<h3>Uploading Copy invoices:</h3>
<p> Suma sends us a copy invoice from Suma Wholefoods (&lt;support@suma.coop&gt;). <br>
This is a very good starting point for entering a delivery (aka order) into the analysis.  <br>
If in fact they don't deliver exactly to the copy invoice, 
then you can edit individual quantities once the column has been created. <br>
But the copy invoice upload is a quick way of creating the column and getting started.<br>
<br>
To upload an invoice:<br>
</p><ul>
<li> Open the email for the main order in your usual email reader (Outlook Express works).</li>
<li> save the attachment (called comething like 16116.A16577.html) to somewhere on your computer (temporarily)</li>
<li> go to the Analysis tool at <a taret="_blank" href="http://ipswichripplefoodcooperative.co.uk/till/tillanalyse.pl">ipswichripplefoodcooperative.co.uk/till/tillanalyse.pl</a></li>
<li> take the "Orders -&gt; Copy invoice Upload" option:</li>
</ul>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <img src="Analinstructions_files/instr_upload_ci.JPG" border="1">
<ul>
<li> use the "Choose File" or Browse button to find your temporary file.</li>
<li> set the "date to save as" be the ordering Tuesday (e.g.7/07/09) but the default (today) will probably be ok.</li>
<li> click "Save to database"</li>
</ul> 
and you should have a new column with the order in it.<br>
You can check this by going back to the Analysis tool and refreshing it<br>
using the "In Last Order Column" filter option:<br>
 &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <img src="Analinstructions_files/instr_last_order_col.JPG" border="1">
 
<a name="GreenSquares"></a>
<hr>
<h3>Green Squares</h3>
<p>This is a quick(er) way to add items to the current order.</p>
<p>If you click on the "Sess remain" square, it will turn green thus:<br>
<img src="Analinstructions_files/Green%2520sqa.gif" border="2" height="306" width="754"></p>
<p><b> You then have to click the refresh/Update button</b> to actually add the tagged items to the current order</p>
<p>The same method cannot be used to remove items from the current order, 
Your have to go to the Notes for the product, and remove the following line from the notes:<br>
 <tt> &nbsp; LASTORDER:XXXX,1</tt><br>
 -  where XXXX is the item code.<br>

</p><p>
</p><hr>
<h3>Creating stocktake columns:</h3>
<p>
This can be done with the Stocktake editor.<br>
There's a link to this at the botton of the analysis screen.<br>
It will offer to edit an existing stocktake, or create a new one.<br>

</p>

<h3>Checking the SUMA shopping cart against order data</h3>
<p>
The "Compare shopping cart" tool lets you do 3 things:<br><br>
- Preview the cart in alphabetical order of product code.<br>
 &nbsp; Since the analysis tool orders its lists this way, this is a quick way to check against a paper list.<br><br>
- Compare the cart with the current order set up in the analysis tool<br>
 &nbsp; these are the items that have been set  with the "Add" button in their notes field.<br><br>

- Compare the cart with a composite of all personal orders since the last session.<br>
 &nbsp; these are the items shown in the Personal order history composite pane<br><br>



To use this tool -<br>
- First go to the SUMA page displaying the shopping cart. <br>
- Next save the current page to a temporary file on your computer (Firefox: File -&gt; Save Page As..)<br>
- Then use the browse button in the compare tool to browse to your saved cart<br>
<br>
- Next use one of the buttons underneath to compare or preview it.<br>
