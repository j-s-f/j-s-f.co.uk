<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">An eye-witness account for those 
of his friends and family who were unable to attend.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">It was AMAZING!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I had earlier asked Robin how 
many of Miss Cho's family and friends were coming from Korea. 'About 15' he 
thought, and we would be 4 or 5 from UK and Denmark, plus probably a few friends 
from Dhaka. I expected there to be about 20-25 guests.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">But slowly the truth dawned, 
when I saw his plan of campaign on his computer. One of the many tasks to do 
during the last few days before the event was to get 150 'order of service' 
programs printed.&nbsp; Another task was to 'see if the concrete was dry' (under the 
tables for the outdoor reception lunch). And to ask the residents committee (of 
the building where his flat is) for permission to hang lights on the front of 
the building - about 2,000 of them. And while he had him/them, to ask if they 
minded a party on the roof in the evening? </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John and I met up 
with Sarah in Dubai on Jan 1st. We had thought she wasn't able to come, but two 
days before, JSF told us over Skype that she <i>was</i> coming, having obtained 
her visa, and booked flights on 'lastminute.com' - the same Emirates flights as 
we were on, both ways! Sarah too had thought a fortnight would be a good length 
of time to get a taste of Bangladesh. (Was Yvonne directing things from above?). 
We had a good flight, much enlivened by local Bangladeshis on the plane, and the 
'in flight entertainment'. We saw 'The Queen'&nbsp; (Helen Mirren: very good) and '<a target="_blank" href="http://www.aninconvenienttruth.co.uk/">An 
inconvenient truth</a>' with Al Gore - an absolute MUST for any thinking being.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;We were met at Zia 
International Airport by Robin and Miss Cho, Kevin and Tara.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">They seemed to think we might 
all 7, plus bags, get into a modest station car taxi, but we opted just for the 
5 of us, Kev and Tara following on in a (bicycle) rickshaw. After a bit of a 
hairy drive (now dark), the last part contra traffic flow, we arrived at their 
new flat - second floor of a modern building with gate and guard in Uttara, a 
suburb north of Dhaka.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Robin has two guest rooms and a guest bathroom, which we 
found very comfortable. As it was winter - not more than 20C, we ladies opted to 
boil water on the stove for washing though John showed his viking blood by 
taking cold showers. Robin had thoughtfully provided mosquito nets, but we saw 
only a very few the whole time we were there, thanks to the temperature and the 
mosquito proof windows in the flat. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next morning I was 
amazed to see out of the window a young man energetically engaged near a fence. 
Was he fighting?, or washing clothes?. Neither: It turned out he was skinning 
some animal (either a goat of a haunch of cow), which was hung up on the 
railings. Robin had explained that the previous day had been the festival of Eid, 
when families return to their villages and sacrifice a cow and give the meat to 
family and the poor: for those in Dhaka a large number of cows and goats are 
brought to a street market to be sold, and dispatched on the spot.

</td></tr><tr><td class="caption" >CNG taxi</td></tr></table>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">There were 
quite a few remains of hooves, horns, ears etc.still lying around in some of the 
side streets. We didn't go to the market street till all was cleared up. However 
we were invited to an 'Eid' lunch by Robin's friend Omi and his wife.  


</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">As Robin 
hadn't been to his new flat, we went by taxi. Five of us plus driver in a green 
3-wheeled 'CNG', a little gas car made for two passengers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Omi is a very cheerful and 
clever computer guy whom Robin had met on the Internet, and who has helped Robin 
with lots of computing. We met his wife and little boy and were sat down to a 
very tasty lunch. The form is that the guests eat alone, while the host stands 
and talks, and the wife slaves away in the kitchen. We were given knives and 
forks, though the Bangladeshis eat with their fingers (of the right hand).&nbsp; 
Omi showed us his 'Certificate of Merit' from Microsoft of which he was proud, 
though I'm not sure why he had been so recognised. But he was clever enough to 
have a hacked version of Windows Vista running on his computer, which showed 
lots of family pictures in a continuous background slide show.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">We had a 
second invitation for the same day, to supper with another friend, Upol, who was 
the husband of a teaching colleague, Sylvia. Again we were fed while Upol and 
his father entertained us. The food was equally good, cooked by Sylvia and her 
mother-in-law. Upol's father was proud to be manager of a 'garment factory' and 
I understood Upol was also employed with garments, but is trying to start his 
own business as he works long hours for very little pay. Robin has given him 
ideas about rebelling from the system, but he is a bright and very nice guy. 
Sylvia is super - we got to know her better at the wedding and party afterwards. 
She teaches at the Korean International school, where Robin is (unpaid) 
'educational consultant'. The day before we left Bangladesh, Robin had organised 
us to give short talks on his teachers' education morning! John completed his, 
but luckily there wasn't time for mine.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">Two days 
before the wedding the Korean contingent arrived in the evening- 5 of Miss Cho's 
family - sisters, brother, in-laws and six or seven from the church, including 
three who were deaf. Miss Cho was very involved with a Korean church for 
handicapped before she came to Bangladesh 18 years ago. Only Mr. Ahn spoke good 
English, so we were a bit quiet to start with. However the lady evangelist 
leader picked up a mat I had made in the afternoon from plaited rope (a copy of 
one found in Denmark), and we started on a sort of 'Blue Peter' activity, which 
broke the ice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">The following 
day Robin and Miss Cho went to the Koreans' hostel for breakfast, and brought 
everyone back to the flat at 11. I thought I had a free morning and was busy 
cleaning the kitchen in bra and shorts (it was warm) when they all came back - 

Robin was somewhat horrified at my deshabille, and blocked the door so the 
Koreans shouldn't be shocked! But later on Miss Cho kitted them out with local 
clothes, there was great dressing up session as they were togged up in saris
 and salwar kameezes.&nbsp; Sarah and I had also loaned some, and felt less conspicuous 
when out in the streets.

<br>In the afternoon we all went out to the edge of the 
town in 7 rickshaws, then walked over a bridge to a village. Typical 
'Bangladesh' scenes, with cows, goats&nbsp; and chickens wandering free, people with 
loads on their heads, rice fields, haystacks and the inevitable corrugated iron 
shacks. As we trouped past a material shop, the shop keeper called out in 
Korean, as he recognised either the language or the way they were, and we were 
all invited to have a cup of tea. Robin is all for meeting the locals, and we 
were found seats, and began chatting. <br><br><br>

(The shopkeeper had spent several years in 
Korea.) Soon quite a crowd had gathered, to no-one's surprise, and Sang Hee 
opened the box of 'mishti' (Bangladeshi sweets) she had brought in case they 
would be useful. Some of the villagers spoke a little English, but mostly Robin 
answered their questions in Bangla - where were we from, why were we here, what 
did we think of Bangladesh, of Bush and Blair and the war in Iraq? And tea, in 
small china cups, with condensed milk, was brought for us all.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">The day 
before the wedding Robin had lots on his plate: last minute arrangements for the 
wedding, meeting Graham and Sandra at the airport, a Christmas service in the 
Armenian church in Old Dhaka and, we discovered at 8.30pm, an appointment at 8 
for a special pre-wedding ceremony. After delayed flights because of fog, (n)ill 
luck with getting the wedding program printed in town due to lack of installed 
Korean fonts, marches and police with riot shields, helmets and batons on the 
way to Old Dhaka, a scary rickshaw ride in ever narrowing streets as dusk fell, 
we eventually were stopped by a lot of police - and then waved on to the 
Armenian Church (police presence because of VIPs, arch bishop, ambassador etc.) 
where we joined a lovely, peaceful and familiar Epiphany service in English, 
with favourite hymns and a good sermon about the message of the wise men being 
that God is for everyone, regardless of race. And tea and cakes afterwards!, 
where we met more of Robin's friends, notably a French lady called Colette and 
an English vicar/missionary/headmistress called Angela, both of whom had 
befriended Robin in times of need, but had discovered such a character that 
acquaintance had deepened to friendship. We had to leave quite quickly in order 
to meet Pop and Sandra at their hotel on time: in fact we were 10 minutes early, 
even after seemingly impassable traffic jams in a mini-taxi in Old Dhaka. Out on 
the edge of town there were no signs of riots or police - not many taxis either, 
but Robin found one, who drove him off to find another while we caught up with 
news from England and tried to prepare Pop and Sandra for what was to come.<br>

Back at the flat we gasped at the sight of the thousands of lights strung over the house - 
strings of Xmas tree fairy lights from top to bottom (6 floors) at half meter 
intervals and an oriental bridal arch also with lights. I looked forward to a 
peaceful evening before the big day, but no! A quick cup of coffee and then out 
to the 'important ceremony', Sang Hee wearing a lovely yellow gold sari. </p>

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">We 
walked a few hundred yards down the road to a private house where friends 
Milton, Lippi, Sheema and others performed a 'Turmeric' ceremony for the bride 
and groom to be. As honoured guests we each received flowers, and fruit and 
sweets and all in turn daubed the happy couple, sitting on cushions in an orange 
bower, with yellow and orange pastes made from spices after a prayer or two had 
been said in both English and Bangla. Kevin and Tara and other friends were 
there too, and Kev promised to bring a printer back to Robin's before midnight 
so he could print off the wedding program, which John and I promised to take 
into town to photocopy next morning.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">The doorbell 
rang at 7.50, and I opened it to Urmi, one of Sang Hee's Korean friends who has 
lived and taught in Bangladesh for 8 years (so au fait with both languages and 
cultures - also English). Miss Cho's appointment at the beauty parlour was at 8, 
but no-one seemed concerned as they all left the house at 8.30. The shops would 
apparently not open till 10, so John and I went forth at 9.45 to the 
photocopier, coincidentally finding the minibus and driver (marked 'Press') that 
Robin had ordered for the day to ferry people and things around - good plan. But 
neither bus nor driver (not English speaking) was around when we eventually got 
out of the shop clutching our 150 warm wedding service sheets. It later 
transpired that Robin had cancelled them for coming 2 hours late...&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't 
know how he managed, in the next 1.5 hours, to buy and transport 150 litres of 
water, fruit juice and serviettes to the reception, pick up and accompany Pop 
and Sandra to the church, and fix Kev to accompany us there by taxi ...'and 
please bring the bridegroom's clothes'! Sarah and I had a fraught 45 minutes 
trying to make each other's saris hang correctly - but we thought they finally 
looked OK. (But <i>after </i>the ceremony, Urmi took us both in hand and did it 
properly - 'there should be <i>pleats,</i> not gathers', and she found us some 
more safety pins, which helped a lot.)</p>

 Mobile phones are everywhere in Bangladesh, and Robin and Kevin (and Omi and Upol) certainly 
make good
use of them. At 11.50 Kev, John, Sarah and I were in a taxi <i>
somewhere</i> in the region of the church, with Robin's clothes and the programs 
in a plastic bag, but it took a slightly frantic call from Robin to direct us 
exactly to the church. I had noticed several signs to the International School 
and thought that someone was having a great party under that huge red and white 
awning without twigging that it was US. <br>

directions on the kitchen table, and I hadn't registered that the International 
Korean Church and school were in the same building. But they were, and there

smiles waiting to greet the guests at the door.<br>

&nbsp;There was simultaneous translation of the whole service into English 
(for us 5), into Bangla and in sign language for Sang Hee and other deaf 
friends. Our Korean English translator introduced himself and sat behind us: 
later he also translated all the English speeches. Luckily Kevin had an extra 
transcription of his (best man's) speech, which was quite long and full of 
unusual words. I have asked for a copy!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">Kevin is a 
good speaker, and read with dignity the wedding lesson on faith, hope and love 
from Corinthians. I read the second reading from Matthew on the impossibility of 
serving both God and money, and how we should not concern ourselves about our 
food and clothes, as God would provide for us. I felt a bit hypocritical seeing 
all the finery around us. But the last verse 'do not worry about tomorrow: 
tomorrow can take care of itself' stood me in good stead later on in the week.&nbsp;&nbsp;

angle before and during the service and, not unusually, afterwards.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I hope to illustrate this 
account with a selection of photos. The Koreans run a close second to the 
Japanese in photography, and I think all were downloaded to Robin's computer 
before people left Bangladesh. We have a DVD that is too full for my poor little 
computer to read.</p>

up in traditional Bangladeshi style, with dark red lipstick and shimmering, gold 
make-up, golden ornaments of her face and hair, and henna and gold patterns on 
her hands. Her sari was red and gold and quite magnificent with a long 
transparent and gold veil. Robin wore a gold coloured tunic and a red stole and 
NEW sandals!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the ceremony 
there was a buffet lunch in the school playground (on new, dry concrete), which 
was decorated with a red and white awning, and with about 20 round, 10-seater 
tables with white chairs. There was both Korean and Bangladeshi food, and plenty 
of water and fruit juice to drink. A two tier iced sponge wedding cake was 
ceremonially cut, and speeches made and translated to Korean and sign language. 
Afterwards a church mini-bus transported some of us and lots of unserved food 
back to the flat, while Kevin and Tara took Pop and Sandra on a rickshaw ride 
round town, which was apparently much enjoyed. At the flat the Koreans unfolded 
a large mat, and all sat cross-legged on the floor opening wedding presents, 
while the Brits took up the chairs and enjoyed a cup of tea. Earlier in the day, 
or maybe the day before, Robin had pushed invitations under the doors of all the 
18 other flats in the building to come and celebrate and eat at 8pm. Many nice 
people turned up: a good opportunity to get to know the neighbours. Several 
business cards were exchanged, with flat numbers pencilled on the back. One pair 
I particularly liked were a couple of doctors - a lady gynaecologist whose 
husband worked for UNICEF. There were some children, one of whom reported 'Dad 
says you have pretty crumby furniture for a foreigner!' - or words to that 
effect. Maybe he was one of the kids who runs the length of the flat above, 
apparently with boots on the tiled floor, every night between 10 and midnight!&nbsp; 
There had been talk of a party on the roof, but it was deemed too cold by the 
natives: it would have been difficult to take the hot food up there anyway.<br>

    making clay bricks individually by hand and putting them in rows to dry in 
    the sun, after which they would be put into the 'kiln' (100m x 20m) for

    made a few bricks, and Sang Hee and I both had a go at pushing the barrows 
    full of clay. It was hard work. The workers received about £1.20 a day for

A young girl (late teens), offered to try it for us, and did so, but we judged 
it wouldn't support our western weights, so turned back. The girl took a liking 
to Sarah, and invited us all in to have tea at her house, and we all trouped 
back to the village and went in, and were invited to sit on the edge of a wooden 
double bed; the rest of the family quickly turned up to look at us and a tray of 
refreshments was brought - I thought it would be rude to say 'no thank you' to 
the proffered glass, and was mighty relieved when the water turned out to be 
Sprite! The warm milk was probably straight from the cow, but tasted good and 
no-one suffered. If fact none of us had any tummy troubles the whole holiday.<br>

alphabet.&nbsp; Rote learning is a large part of the program, but Robin goes in once 
a week and does more creative things with them - making mastermazes, bonga board 
and other toys he enjoyed as a child. I find it hard to imagine how one can 
teach a totally deaf child to speak: it apparently starts with mouth positions 
and feeling an unambiguous sound on the front of the throat. The children spoke 
with varying pitches of the voice, some very high. Being deaf is a social 
stigma, so deaf people, as Miss Cho found out, have an extra hard time. This was 
why Sang Hee decided to work for other deaf in Bangladesh.

different pieces, many of which were English bible texts, but some more national 
scenes. The embroidery is sent to USA and sold. Robin and Sang Hee had given me

had been made there. One of the widows showed me the many holes in her fingers,

Before lunch we were shown round 
the T.B. clinic where Robin had worked as administrator a few years ago, housed 
in an old fort-like building. Since his time there, the windows had been nicely 
painted and tiles had appeared on the walls of the 'laboratory'. We walked back 
to the bus through the shanty town where slum dwellers from Dhaka had been 
rehoused some years ago.</p>

the open window, IFig46 had good views of the countryside. Flat, of course, becoming 
rural with small rice fields, with low earth banks round them, cows tethered 
singly in fields, goats, chickens and ducks wandering around. Lots of people 
working, planting rice, carrying pots or bundles on their heads, tilling fields 
with a pair of oxen and a wooden plough with a few having mechanical 
cultivators. All their clothes were colourful, and no-one was fat. Both fruit 
sellers and beggars came to the window when we stopped at a station - some 
beggars, unable to walk, somehow got onto the train and shuffled along on the 
floor, between all the standing passengers. Blind men also came past, their hand

2pm.&nbsp; The tea plantation was huge and was interesting to see - also the 
rubber plantation, the 'Club' for the planters - really colonial with a billiard 
room with two full size tables, a&nbsp; 'ladies room' with arm chairs and 2 dressing 
tables with big mirrors, a card room, a dance floor and thatched bar, all 
surrounded by a big verandah. Lovely gardens with butterflies, birds, flowers, 
lawns, tennis courts and cricket pitch. Also a very large children's play area 
with swings and slides, towers, balancing beams - not unlike a standard European 
playground (though only for the use of the planters children - not the locals)<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">At Mr. 
Rahman's bungalow we met his 10-year-old daughter, Rubra, and (later) his wife. 
We were also shown round his garden, where as a keen biologist, he tried to grow 
various plants. But he complained this was difficult, owing to all the pesticide 
residues since the land had been tea plantation until 10 years earlier. Rubra 
was a bight and cheerful child who spoke very good English, and said she would 
like to go to school in England - though was a little more doubtful when I 
explained there would be no servants at her beck and call. Mr. Rahman had 10 in 
his household, but explained that also included 'two for sleeping'. (Night 
guards?) Robin's friend, Angela, had explained that a 15-year-old daughter of a 
well-off Bangladeshi could not even tie her shoelaces, as she had servants to do 
it for her. Towards dusk we were driven off to see some rain forest, where we 
might see gibbons. We heard them, and had a pleasant walk, but it really was too 
dark to see anything much. We saw really massive teak and iroko trees. Later in 
the evening we had the day's share of anxiety as Robin negotiated tickets for 
our return by train the next day. A long time, several phone calls and a bit 
more than usual baksheesh were required. However we got the tickets at least 
three minutes before the train departed the next morning, and were delighted to 
find ourselves in a compartment to ourselves. Sarah and I made use of the 
sleeper bunks, and the journey passed quite quickly. At least we could see where 
we were going, and knew when to get out! It was <i>lovely</i> to get back to the 
clean and comfortable flat, and to spend the evening with Robin and Sang Hee, 
watching some of Robin's films, notably one on 9-11, which has certainly raised 
our awareness of the real world. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">On our last 
day in Dhaka, we participated in a half day teacher training course organized by 
Robin at the international school, visited Colette and Mr. Alim, a most 
interesting French/Bengali couple who had 'befriended' Robin through the 
Armenian Church , and in the evening another visit to Upol and Sylvia, which 
ended with Mr. Rahman taking us all, including Sylvia and Mrs. Rahman, to dinner 
at a modern restaurant called the Baton Rouge: he showed with amusement the logo 
on the porcelain, which said 'Beton Rouge', which, the waiter explained, was a 
spelling mistake! The 11 pm curfew, which had been imposed two days before, was 
no longer in force, but we all voted to go home as quickly as possible in order 
to pack.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">We had a 
slightly delayed departure, but were inexplicably upgraded to business class, 
and although Sarah missed her connection to Heathrow, she was found a hotel room 
in Dubai and booked on another flight next morning. We managed also to get a 
room at the same hotel and had a comfortable night, with a hot shower and clean 
sheets on a spring mattress, which fortified us for our 18 hour journey home via 
Hamburg next day.&nbsp; The good bit was the free breakfast in Dubai airport and then 
a comfortable, if delayed, flight: the bad bit was finding the car battery flat 
in Hamburg airport. But then the good bit was having the jump leads in the car 
and finding a friendly German to help us start and then a trouble free drive to 
catch two ferries to be home to Clint by 9.30pm.</p>

the sheer number of people moving from A to B in so many forms 
of apparently precarious and over loaded transport that worried me, though we 
didn't see a single traffic accident. There is a system to all the horn blowing, 
Fig50and the bicycle rickshaws have loud bells and very good breaks, if no lights - 
though out in the villages I saw paraffin hurricane lamps swinging from the back 
axle. There were no loutish teenagers hanging on street corners - I think they 
were earning their bread/rice as rickshaw wallahs. Many people on the 
frantically overcrowded busses spoke English and talked to us - even began to 
teach us Bangla: &quot;Amer nam Sue!&quot; But it was unnerving not to know which bus we 
should be trying to jump onto (because we didn't know the system or read Bangla) 
and how long the journey would last. Robin had a super plan for the holiday in 
his head, but he seemed reluctant to share it with us before the very last 
moment. Maybe this is a reflection of how I treated the boys when young: I never 
wanted to tell them about a (pleasant) surprise event in advance in case it 
didn't happen and they would be disappointed: but it <i>is</i> more reassuring 
to know what is going on!</p>

over-protected Europeans, but there seemed to be a system. I was pleased our

thought many times what a blessing it was that Muslims do not allow alcohol. 
They are not over burdened with packaging and advertisements in the local shops, 
though this has arrived in the western style shops: noticeably the
Fig51street 
hoarding advertisements for shampoo etc. were of western brands, showing 
extremely pale skinned models.&nbsp; The small CNG taxis and many busses run on gas, 
so the traffic fumes aren't as bad as in European cities - or maybe it was just 
my heavy cold that prevented me from smelling them. All in all the trip was an 
amazing experience, and we shall go again for another visit- but I think I am 
too conservative to swap our home on Fejoe for a thatched hut in a village in 
Bangladesh, even though the mosquitoes I saw there were far smaller and easier 
to swat than ours!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:36.0pt">I think that 
Bangladesh suits Robin very well - there aren't many rules to obey, except those 
for self survival. He is able to use his brain and have time to develop his own 
thoughts. I was astounded to see how he enabled Sang Hee to have a phone 
conversation with her Korean friends: she rings the number, and Robin listens to 
hear when it is answered. Then Sang Hee speaks and when she has finished, Robin 
takes the receiver and listens to the answer, repeating the Korean (which he 
hasn't yet learned) he hears with sufficient accuracy that Sang Hee can lipread 
the answer! I think they will have a good marriage, but it will be different 
from the average!</p>
